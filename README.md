About the Project
The Recipe Sharing Web Application is a full-stack web platform built using Django and MongoDB, designed to allow users to share, explore, and manage cooking recipes in a user-friendly environment.

Users can register and add their own recipes with images, videos, and detailed instructions. Recipes are categorized by cuisine, meal type (like breakfast, lunch, dinner), and general categories (such as pizza, drinks, desserts). The app also includes a robust search feature that helps users quickly find specific dishes.

This project aims to create a collaborative cooking space where food lovers can interact and share their culinary knowledge with others.
